## About
I designed this project to learn about websockets, and experiment with writing my own game server.

The primary directives of the project include:
- minimalism;
- optimization and abstraction;
- simplicity;
- flexibility; and
- extensibility.

All of these together encompass the thought process that went into this project as I actively developed it.
